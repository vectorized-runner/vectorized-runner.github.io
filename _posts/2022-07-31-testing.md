Hi, this is my first blog post and I wanted to make it about performance.

Here's the story, while coding the gameplay logic the systems in our game use lots of temporary lists which are discarded by the end of frame. 

If we use the C# list in the System namespace, we create a lot of garbage and the GC has to run frequently. The CPU usage spikes caused by the GC is not acceptable for our games, even if it happens for some frames.

Today I want to talk about list optimizations I've done over time, merged in one data structure which I will call StackOnlyList.

```cs
using System;

private void TheLogic()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Amazing stuff here!");
}


```


Does it work?
