Hi, this is my first blog post, and I wanted to make it about performance.

Here's the story, while coding gameplay logic for our games, we use lots of temporary lists, process them and discard it every frame.

If we use the default C# list, the GC runs too frequently and the performance hit is not acceptable.

I've discovered many patterns over time, and want to merge them in one custom list data structure, I call it StackList.

```cs
using System;

private void TheLogic()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Amazing stuff here!");
}


```


Does it work?
